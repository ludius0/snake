# snake
UPDATE:

After three months, when I tried my first attempt to make snake game and basically failed miserably, because I couldn't do it without help (I didn't undertood that code very much). Yesterday I tried again and nailed it. This time I figured out simple and great algorithm for figuring out moving of snake.

Your snake is list with tuples, which holds x and y values. For every step (loop), algorithm take the head of snake and put another before that head with coresponding direction and delete the tail. Also this time I can already wrap my head around OOP, so it worked out great.
